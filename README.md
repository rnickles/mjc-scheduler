# mjc-scheduler
This is an ad-hoc course scheduler for the Yosemite Community College District, which includes Modesto Junior College and Columbia College.
I built this to play around with kivy and to see what was possible using web crawlers. 
The app pulls raw HTML data from the course-search website and then parses it into a format that the app can work with. 
An algorithm then outputs valid schedules based on which courses the user selected.
